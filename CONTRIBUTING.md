Contributions are much appreciated!

I'm not sure what exactly to put here, except for just use common sense and try to roughly inherit the code style. Check issues for issues and suggestions.

Before blindly implementing a new feature, please make sure it's a wanted feature and that it integrates well.

Try your best at not breaking anything and test everything before submitting a PR (Duh)

When contributing, **please don't forget** to add your name (and links) to the [humans.txt](humans.txt) :)

Probably most needed: Translations using [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/), and everything in the Issues-Tab.
